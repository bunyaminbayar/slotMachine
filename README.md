### Technology Choices

1. **HTML5**: 
   - Chosen for its simplicity and universality in structuring web pages. HTML5 provides the basic framework and semantics for the slot machine game.

2. **CSS3**:
   - Used for styling the game. CSS3 allows for a visually appealing design with modern features such as flexbox for layout, keyframe animations for dynamic effects, and responsive design to ensure the game looks good on various screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
   - Chosen for its versatility and capability to handle the interactive aspects of the game. JavaScript is used to manage the spinning reels, detect winning combinations, and trigger visual effects such as fireworks.
   - The code uses modern JavaScript features such as classes, template literals, and arrow functions to enhance readability and maintainability.

### Design and Functionality
- The slot machine game is designed to be simple yet engaging. It includes three reels with random symbols, a spin button, and visual effects to celebrate wins.
- The use of keyframe animations in CSS provides a smooth spinning effect for the reels.
- JavaScript handles the game logic, including the randomization of symbols, checking for wins, and triggering winning animations.
